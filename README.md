This repository contains a simplified version of the popular game "Angry Birds". The goal of the game is to launch birds using a slingshot to destroy all the pigs on the playing field. This project demonstrates basic game development concepts such as physics simulation, collision detection, and simple AI.

## Features
- **Slingshot Mechanics**: Pull back the slingshot to launch birds at varying speeds and angles.
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic movement and collision using a physics engine.
- **Multiple Levels**: Different levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Simple AI**: Pigs have basic behaviors and reactions to being hit.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and simply preview code updates in index.html. You only need to run package.json to install the testing library, which is recommended to ensure all functionalities are running as expected.
